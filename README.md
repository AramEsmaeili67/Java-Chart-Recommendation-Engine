# Java-Chart-Recommendation-Engine

The "Java Chart Recommendation Engine" is a tool designed to assist users in selecting the most appropriate chart type based on their specific data visualization needs. It offers an interactive interface where users can input the purpose or requirements of their chart, such as comparing data, displaying maximum values, or showing frequency distributions.

Upon receiving user input, the recommendation engine analyzes the requirements and suggests the optimal chart type accordingly. For example, it might recommend a "Pie Chart" for comparing data with the whole, a "Bar Chart" for displaying maximum values, or a "Histogram" for showing frequency distributions.

By leveraging this recommendation engine, users can streamline the process of selecting the most suitable chart type for their data, enhancing the effectiveness and clarity of their visualizations.
